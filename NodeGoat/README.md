# NodeGoat

Being lightweight, fast, and scalable, Node.js is becoming a widely adopted platform for developing web applications. This project provides an environment to learn how OWASP Top 10 security risks apply to web applications developed using Node.js and how to effectively address them.

## Getting Started

OWASP Top 10 for Node.js web applications:

### Know it!

[Tutorial Guide](http://nodegoat.herokuapp.com/tutorial) explaining how each of the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities can manifest in Node.js web apps and how to prevent it.

### Do it!

[A Vulnerable Node.js App for Ninjas](http://nodegoat.herokuapp.com/) to exploit, toast, and fix. You may like to [set up your own copy](#how-to-set-up-your-copy-of-nodegoat) of the app to fix and test vulnerabilities. Hint: Look for comments in the source code.

##### Default user accounts

The database comes pre-populated with these user accounts created as part of the seed data -
* Admin Account - u:admin p:Admin_123
* User Accounts (u:user1 p:User1_123), (u:user2 p:User2_123)
* New users can also be added using the sign-up page.

## How to Set Up Your Copy of NodeGoat

### OPTION 1 - Run NodeGoat on your machine

1) Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) - NodeGoat requires Node v8 or above

2) Clone the github repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/OWASP/NodeGoat.git
   ```

3) Go to the directory:
   ```
   cd NodeGoat
   ```

4) Install node packages:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

5) Set up docker instance for MongoDB.
   ```
   docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --name nodegoat-mongo mongo:4.4.6
   ```

6) Populate MongoDB with the seed data required for the app:
   ```
   npm run db:seed
   ```
   By default this will use the "development" configuration, but the desired config can be passed as an argument if required.

7) Start the server. You can run the server using node or nodemon:
   * Start the server with node. This starts the NodeGoat application at [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/):
     ```
     npm start
     ```
   * Start the server with nodemon, which will automatically restart the application when you make any changes. This starts the NodeGoat application at [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/):
     ```
     npm run dev
     ```

8) Modify the password of the cypress.env.json file:
     ```
     {
         "password": ""

      }
     ```

#### Customizing the Default Application Configuration

By default the application will be hosted on port 4000 and will connect to a MongoDB instance at localhost:27017. To change this set the environment variables `PORT` and `MONGODB_URI`.

Other settings can be changed by updating the [config file](https://github.com/OWASP/NodeGoat/blob/master/config/env/all.js).
